# CIS-7 Discrete Structures Course Project
## Case 3: Vigenere Cipher Encryption and Decryption

### Project Description
This project implements the Vigenère Cipher using C++. The program encrypts and decrypts alphabetic messages using a repeating keyword and modular arithmetic. The project demonstrates how discrete structures concepts can be applied to cryptography.

### Discrete Structures Concepts Used
- Modular arithmetic (mod 26)
- Symbol-to-number mapping (A–Z → 0–25)
- Repeating sequences
- Algorithmic encryption and decryption

### Programming Approach
The program converts characters to numeric values and applies encryption and decryption formulas using modulo 26. Spaces and punctuation are preserved, and the program verifies correctness by comparing decrypted output with the original plaintext.

### How to Use
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter a plaintext message.
4. Enter a keyword.
5. View the encrypted and decrypted output.
